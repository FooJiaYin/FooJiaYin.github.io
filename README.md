I am learning how to use github. I created a repository and then a branch named "edit". "Edit" is a copy of the default "master" branch. All the changes will be merge into the master branch after discussion. Obviously here is only ME. So I am gonna discuss this with myself, by pulling request. Fantastic. See you.
